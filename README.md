These are the scripts used to do the analysis for my PhD dissertation "Exploring Human Activities in Cities using Data and Model".

There are 3 research questions:

RQ1: How can we explore food related disscussions of people using social media data? 

RQ2: How can we link social media data to traffic data to examine the impact of events on traffic flow?

RQ3: How can we use these results to forecast the impact of different types of events on traffic flow? 

Each script provides analysis on the corrsponding question.
